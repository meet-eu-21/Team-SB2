# Install and launch

First you need to clone our repository :
```
git clone https://github.com/meet-eu-21/Team-SB2
```
After that you have to install the requirements :
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then to launch the code :
```
python main.py
```
The following panel will come up, you can enter the numbers of the chromosomes you want to analyse and select the cell lines and the resolution **(be careful ! : launching too many chromosomes can make a runtime memory error)**.

![panel](https://github.com/meet-eu-21/Team-SB2/blob/main/images/panel.png?raw=true)

Here you have an example of the selection to run an analysis for **GM12878**, **HUVEC** and **IMR90** with the chromosomes **11**, **X** and **4** in **100kb**.

The notebook **Plot_histo.pynb** can then be used to make the histograms of the results to compare the cell lines.

# Our work

Class diagram of our code :

![diagram](https://github.com/meet-eu-21/Team-SB2/blob/main/images/class_diagram.png?raw=true)

Our results for 100kb are available in the folder **/Results**

All **.py** files except **color_b.py** are used for our analysis. Two methods are used :
- With the first method, we search the number of compartments with an HMM using the data from the correlation matrix
- With the second method, we search the number of compartments with an HMM using the data from epigenetic marks.

The file **color_b.py** can be used with **Pymol** to see the colors of the compartments of the **.pdb** files of our results. (**color_b.py** can be put in **Pymol** folder). You need to run the following command in **Pymol** after opening the **.pdb** result you want to see : 
```
run path_to_our_folder\Team-SB2\color_b.py
color_b()
```
Here is an example of the colors that can be seen on the **.pdb** file of chromosome **22** of **HMEC** with the compartments of the HMM method with correlation matrix :

# Example of results

## Example of data obtained with the correlation matrix method of chromosome 16 from GM12878 :

## Example of data obtained with the epigenetic marks method of chromosome 16 from GM12878 :

### Our predictions :
```
###################################HMM Contact###################################
Similarity score with Leopold: 74.972 %
Best compartment number : 7

###################################HMM Epigenetic###################################
Similarity score with Leopold: 64.673 %
Best compartment number : 5
```
